To Do List:
	Add in proper multiplayer movement
	
	Make a File outlining the flow of sending data from server to clients, and from client to server.
		This will be needed for when I need to add additional data travel.
		
	Add in way to turn, even if by keyboard for now (Q/E)
		Partially implemented.  Q/E do rotate the model but it is not a fluid rotation.  
		Also it affects the movement speed of WASD somehow, increasing it a ton after rotating around.
			Certain Y rotation angles have different movement speeds.
		Also, rotation force rotates the VR camera.  While this makes sense logically, may be sickness inducing.
	
		
	*GameObjects
		Tweak LocalPlayer prefab
			Make cylinder horizontal to represent the bike
			Adjust player head/hand location to th front top of the bike
	
	Networking
		Replace Networking player rotation code with bike rotation code.  We dont need to send the direction a player is physically looking
		Replace WASD with constant forward bike motion
		Replace WASD keyboard input with VR Controls
			Maybe just read a handle bar turn amount (float) and send that to the server, which then figures out how hard to turn bike if at all.
			This keeps the vr hand positions local to the client and probably saves a lot of networking resources than sending hand positions.

Unimportant To Do:
	Grid Neon Flashing as scene here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8A0yojNfhA
		Even the particles effects seem neat.


Completed:
	Setup bloom (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd1pmR1afGk.  Around 8:30 mark)
	Add in VR Camera  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYtahQjmWQ&t=327s)
	
	On connect, move to neon grid
		In theory this done.
		Needs to have the scene change occur AFTER successful connection, if and only if connection was successful.
