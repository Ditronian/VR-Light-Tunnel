Cube Notes:

	Scale: 1.25 is one quarter the size of a plane
	
	
	Top Left:  -.625, 2.875, -.625 AND .625		Assuming doing two squares
	
	Top Right:  .625, 2.875, -.625 AND .625		Assuming doing two squares
	
	Bottom Left:  -.625, 1.625, -.625 AND .625		Assuming doing two squares
	
	Bottom Right:  .625, 1.625, -.625 AND .625		Assuming doing two squares
	
	
	New Ideas:
		Set material on awake, selected by your speed, or where at in the song.
			Test and make new colors
		Have tunnels, ie make the current 2x2 a 4x4
		
		Diffusion between 5 and 7 over the course of about a 1.5 seconds
		
		1.25
